# TimeSpare Proposal

### TimeSpare 
TimeSpare is an employment-oriented network service that provides users access to quick and temporary job openings in their local area.   

It is aimed to provide hourly work opportunities to individuals with specific skillsets who are looking to fulfill their free time with meaningful work in their community. 

## Background and Overview
Sometimes, you find yourself with some free-time. You’re tired of laying around in bed all Saturday, or waiting for your next customer as an Uber driver. TimeSpare fills those idle times with purposeful work by connecting you with locals around you who need your skills.

We believe that good things happen when people help each other, whether across town or towards their dreams. Opportunities appear, open up, and become reality.
